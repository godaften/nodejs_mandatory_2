# MERN GOLDEN COFFEE

# Simple webshop with sample products imported from data.js through seedRoutes.js - run localhost:5000/api/seed to create sample products and one admin user
# Choose sign in to sign in with a user or create new user
# Home, product and cart - checkout button just redirects to same page
# Add to cart from home and product - adjust number of items in cart
# Notifications with React toastify
# Emails - I've tried many things to get nodemailer to work both with smtp and sendgrid. No luck so I've commented it out
# Authentication with bcrypt
# Authorization with jwt
# Protected route to user profile (must be signed in)
